To pick off from where we left off in our Needs Analysis Phase, we continued to work to work on well-rounded personas that would allow us to better understand our users. We created the following personas to represent the space of the small business owners:


* Got it Together Jessica: DESCRIBE
* Online Olivia: DESCRIBE
* Busy Brian: DESCRIBE
* Not So Savvy Nancy: DESCRIBE

#### Interaction Flow/Storyboard


After categorizing the needs and goals of our users into these personas, we then proceeded to use this information to understand some of the design requirements that each persona would impose on our design. We then categorized those design requirements, looking for similarities in requirements that would better inform the implementation we should continue with.

With these in mind, we decided to flesh out three approaches that met different intersections of needs for our personas. The first was the most similar to our original idea, a platform that consolidates most all of the userâ€™s communications onto one platform. The second approach was that of a product management system that allows the business owner to easily access their product/service information to share with customers. The third approach is a social media posting platform that will help maintain pages across multiple platforms, as well as guide with posting.

Because we took a bit more time to better understand our users and their needs, we have not gotten as far with selecting a design approach to continue with and tested with our users. With the time restriction we are working in, we decided to further flesh out the three preliminary ideas that we came up with and perform a less thorough version of the user testing process with each of these, in order to both practice the design development skills and further develop these ideas in order to choose the best one to continue with.


#### Design Ideas


Cross Platform Message Consolidation

This design implementation focuses on the fact that many business owners receive multiple messages across various platforms, and that the most common way to respond to these messages is to check each platform individually. 


This implementation for a message consolidation platform is designed with the needs and wants of Jessica and Olivia more so than our other two personas. This was designed to be a phone app because these two personas have easy access to their phone while at work and are constantly alert for incoming notifications.

After sketching out this idea, we created a small flow diagram for how this platform would work for these target two personas, and a paper prototype for initial tests.

The flowcharts currently are a great simplification for how these personas would interact with this platform, but served as an initial basis to start to think about how to design the app.


From performing limited user testing with Oliners, the area that seemed to need the most further attention and development was the template implementation.
