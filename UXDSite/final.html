					<h2 id="formal-usability-study-plan">Formal Usability Study Plan</h2>
					<p>In this study, we would like to test two different layout designs of our platform to learn which
						layout is more understandable and efficient for the user.</p>
					<h4 id="hypothesis-">Hypothesis:</h4>
					<p>The table layout will be more time-efficient than the switches layout and the users will be able
						to answer questions about food allergens faster. </p>
					<p>To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a usability test with 2-3 different people who have
						worked in a front-of-house restaurant. In this test, we will introduce 5-6 different scenarios
						where the user needs to find information and then we will measure how the participant responds.
					</p>
					<h4 id="independent-variables-">Independent Variables:</h4>
					<p>We will be changing the visual format of each menu item. One of our layouts will have the menu
						items in card format and have switches that filter the data. The other layout will have a table
						that presents all of the information and not have the option to filter the data with switches.
					</p>
					<h4 id="quantitative-metrics-dependent-variables-">Quantitative Metrics (Dependent Variables):</h4>
					<h5 id="access-time-">Access time.</h5>
					<p>This can be measured in terms of either the number of clicks required to access the required
						information or the amount of time the user spends on operations. We would like to measure which
						approach has the more optimized time.</p>

						<p>List format</p>

					<h5 id="misclicks-">Misclicks.</h5>
					<p>We would like to measure the deviation in the user’s click flow from the “optimal” flow to reach
						a certain screen. This metric would be useful in measuring how clear/confusing our interface
						design is. An accurate hypothesis would have fewer misclicks. </p>

						<h5 id="type-of-gestures-clicks-">Type of gestures/clicks.</h5>
					<p>We would measure what kind of gestures people use and if they are what we think are the optimal
						ones. This metric would help us understand if the required gestures are obvious through our
						designs.</p>
					<h4 id="questions-for-a-b-testing-">Questions for A/B testing:</h4>
					<p>Do you think the tables layout has way too much information?</p>
					<p>Does the scrolling mechanism take too much time to find certain items?</p>
					<p>Is filtering or a table view more intuitive for searching for information?</p>
					<p>Which method of search seems more powerful?</p>
					<h2 id="results-of-formal-usability-study">Results of Formal Usability Study</h2>
					<h4 id="overview">Overview</h4>
					<p>We tested two versions of information presentation for our system: A table layout version, and a
						list layout version. To determine which design direction we should go we consulted with two
						users. These users both liked the system but saw places for improvement. Both preferred the
						table format, however felt that the filtering functionality needed clearer affordances.</p>
					<h4 id="response-variables-formal-usability-study-">Response Variables (formal usability study):
					</h4>
					<h5 id="access-time">Access time</h5>
					<p>Both testers responded to questions about information retrieval faster using the tabular design.
						They liked the aligned columns of icons and larger format and disliked the lack of those things
						in the list design. (Figure 1)</p>

						Figure 1: A Side by Side comparison of the tabular format (left) and the list format (right)</p>
					<h5 id="misclicks">Misclicks</h5>
					<p>Both testers misclicked / were uncertain when trying to utilize the filtering system in the
						tabular design. One user resorted to trying to search with the search bar. The system was
						unclear. On the flipside, the list design made filtering very clear. (Figure 2)</p>

						the right, the clicked section header indicates we are filtering to Dairy-Free options.</p>
					<h5 id="type-of-gestures-clicks">Type of gestures/clicks</h5>
					<p>Both testers said they would avoid typing. They also didn’t expect any gestures outside of
						clicking but this is likely affected by the format they were interacting with: An iPad emulated
						on a computer through a web browser.</p>
					<h4 id="specific-feedback-informal-usability-study-">Specific Feedback (informal usability study):
					</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>Confused about how to interact with the system at first. Thought they had to click on items
							in order to answer the asked questions. After about 5 seconds understood that the questions
							could be answered from the main page.</li>
						<li>Didn’t understand what the greyed out icons were supposed to be. After about 15 seconds
							understood what it meant to be greyed out. After about 30 seconds saw the text that
							described what it meant to be greyed out.</li>
						<li>Dairy free -&gt; Tried to search for it first<ul>
								<li>Then tried the section header.</li>
								<li>Suggested potentially highlighting some of the tabs already to imply that all of
									them can be toggled (not sure how I feel about this, but at any rate we require more
									visibility for the clickability of the table headers).</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Thought we should have a soup and salad section.</li>
						<li>Liked the menu section separation in the app. Said it would make it faster to navigate
							without searching.</li>
						<li>Make the design less flat and more intuitive for hectic restaurant environments. This means
							making the buttons look like buttons and less like a cool tech app. Also make the words much
							bigger and the side tabs more functional. </li>
					</ul>
					<h4 id="interpretation-of-response-variable-results">Interpretation of Response Variable Results
					</h4>
					<p>Both testers were able to find information in the table design fairly quickly when compared to
						the list format. One mentioned that the consistent horizontal location of the icons allowed for
						easy searching and learning of where to find the important information. They also mentioned that
						more spacing and bigger size for the icons allowed for better access. This implies that the
						table layout will allow people in hectic situations find information easily, and those new to
						the system still be able to use it effectively.</p>
					<p>Both testers were confused by the sorting by category system in the table design. This is due to
						a lack of affordances to show that those headers are clickable. In fact, one of the testers
						assumed that the search bar was the only way to do this. This implies that in a real world
						situation users may utilize the application without ever finding this very important feature.
					</p>
					<h4 id="going-forward">Going Forward</h4>
					<p>Going forward we are going to work with the table format. We plan to utilize the feedback we’ve
						gotten to further improve the application. We will make the section headers appear more
						clickable, potentially just make them buttons. This way the table format will become more
						usable. We also plan to make the text and icons bigger so as to make the system easily usable
						even in high stress environments. With these changes users should have a much more pleasant time
						understanding the system, and a much more efficient time extracting information from the system.
