						<h1>Design Refinement</h1>
					</header>
					
					<p>Submitted: 11/12/19</p>
					<h1 id="current-design">Current Design</h1>
					<p>Our design right now is an app designed for servers and hostesses at restaurants to help them
						navigate dietary restrictions better. The app is designed to be used on a keyboard-less tablet
						and help answer customer questions about various items and their ingredients. The interface is
						designed to be simple, with toggle switches for common dietary restrictions which can be chosen
						by the restaurant and the ability to inspect any item’s ingredients by clicking on it. </p>
					<p><img src="images/CurrDesign0.png" width="60%"></p>
					<!--![A picture of the Design.  There is a Search Bar, List of available Foods, and two switches to limit results to Vegan and Dairy Free dietary Restrictions.  The whole picture is framed by an Ipad, implying it is a tablet application.](./CurrDesign0.png)-->
					<p>Clicking on an item like the house salad leads to a page where the ingredients of that item along
						with the dietary restrictions it doesn’t comply with are marked. This allows servers and
						hostesses to easily answer questions on what makes up a certain dish. </p>
					<p><img src="images/CurrDesign1.png" width="60%"></p>
					<p><img src="images/CurrDesign2.png" width="60%"></p>
					<p>The edit button on this page allows restaurants to be modify the page if and when they choose to
						change their menu/ modify and item. It allows them to delete/add any ingredients and/or notes.
						They can also mark it as out of stock so that they can be aware of its status when talking to
						guests. </p>
					<p><img src="images/CurrDesign3.png" width="60%"></p>
					<p>Our design also allows for the indication of customizability of items indicating how certain
						ingredients can swapped out in some items to make them compliant to certain dietary
						restrictions.</p>

					<h1 id="paper-prototype">Paper Prototype</h1>
					<p>Our current designed evolved from the searching platform we presented in the Design Refinement
						phase.</p>
					<p><img src="images/PaperProto0.png" width="60%"></p>
					<p>We took this design and thought critically about what persona we wanted to design for. We chose
						to evolve our design to better suit Busy Brian because our initial platform design was too broad
						as we wanted it to serve various functions for different personas. Below is the second iteration
						of the paper prototype, narrowed to reflect that the product sold is food and the information
						that is shared is ingredient/allergen information.</p>
					<p><img src="images/PaperProto1.png" width="60%"></p>
					<p>In the paper prototype, we were unsure of what platform our design would be on. We looked further
						into the types of devices that users similar to Busy Brian had at their disposal. We learned
						that many restaurants had tablets, such as the Toast POS system that could be a useful device
						for our platform as well. This table would be great for displaying lots of information, but one
						trade off that we discovered is that its difficult to use the on screen keyboard. From this
						insight, we pivoted away from just a search bar for navigation and instead provided an
						alphabetical list or items, as well as a search bar for navigation. </p>

						<hr class="major" />

					<h1 id="design-decisions-rationale">Design Decisions Rationale</h1>
					<p>Another design decision we made was for the use case where people have multiple dietary
						restrictions. From this we change the dietary restriction buttons on the right into toggle
						switches so that the user can select multiple dietary restrictions. With the toggle switched we
						needed to decide what made sense visually as an on or off state. For instance, if someone could
						not have food with dairy, would that mean the dairy switch was on or off? We decided to change
						the text to say “Dairy Free”, instead of just “Dairy”, to eliminate this confusion. </p>
					<p>Furthermore, after presenting our first iteration of the food item display page, it was brought
						to our attention that modifications could be made to an order to make something fit a dietary
						restriction. We implemented this design decision by placing an asterisk next to the names of
						foods that could be modified and added a note at the bottom with how it could be modified. We
						also added a notes section to each item page so that the restaurant could specify how the dish
						could be changed. </p>

						<hr class="major" />


					<h1 id="project-refinement">Project Refinement</h1>
					<p>We continued to evolve our prototype to make it a simpler platform. We ran into the issue of
						“wanting to do it all” while designing, but during our team discussions, we stopped to think
						about what we wanted the main functionality to be. Business managers such as Brian are too busy
						to learn an entire new system, and will not want to use if it’s too complicated. We settled on
						focusing the ingredients/allergen information in the food that they sell.</p>
					<p>The other reason for scoping down our project is that it was too much for the team to take on
						with its current bandwidth. A more concrete and simpler project actually allowed us to think
						more creatively about the way that we want the presentation to look as we have a better idea of
						what features we actually want to implement.</p>
					<p>When we did decide on doing the dietary restriction services, we then talked to 5-6 restaurants
						to understand how they currently dealt with this issue. The responses ranged from using 3 ring
						binders to “we know it in our heads”. All the processes we learnt about were either too slow and
						laborious or seemed to contain a high amount of uncertainty/risk. This process helped us because
						we were able to understand there we needs like explaining customizability and ease of editing
						that we were not previously aware of. We then modified our prototype to include those features.
					</p>

					<hr class="major" />

					<h1 id="design-insight">Design Insight</h1>
					<p>One of the major insights we got from the restaurant owners and people we talked to is that it
						was crucial that we have this system integrate into the existing infrastructure and way of
						management at the restaurant. Designing as engineers optimizing for speed/efficiency would
						probably have led us to make a product which might not be very well received by our target user
						group. So, we designed a system that best fit our user’s needs. </p>
					
					
						<h2 id="remaining-questions">Remaining Questions</h2>
					<p>The questions we still have regarding the prototype are the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>If there is a longer list of menu items, does the alphabetical list of menu items make the
							most sense for navigation?</li>
						<li>Could this system be maintained by a restaurant staff or is the activation energy to add new
							items too much work?</li>
						<li>Are these the most frequently asked about allergens?</li>
						<li>Do customers trust this system to correctly display allergen information?</li>
						<li>What other features might be needed?</li>
					</ul>
					<hr>
					<h1 id="heuristic-evaluation-from-odditos-team">Heuristic Evaluation from Odditos Team</h1>
					<p>Overall Impression:
						The application has the strengths of simplicity and organization. The layout of the page is very
						nice and seems as though it is optimized for handheld use. I also like the choices of light
						color tones, it makes for an appealing interface while also amplifying the tasks within the
						application. Going forward we suggest interviewing waiters to see what their opinion is on the
						platform and its services. The quickness of everything they have to doat the table is crucial.
						The less they have to move around to find the information they need the better.</p>
					<h2>Heuristic Evaluation:</h2>
					<ol>
						<li>[Visibility of system status] (Severity 3) - 2 of us
							After changing the ingredients of a dish, the ingredients list won’t be updated if we leave
							the page and come back again.</li>
						<li>[Visibility of System Status] (Severity 4) - 1 of us
							The starting page confused me of its location within the app. There is no home page or
							starting scene which can confuse the user on their location within the platform. There also
							are no back buttons or any navigation keys</li>
						<li>[Visibility of System Status] (Severity 4) - 1 of us
							There is no home bar or directory tools to know that the search screen is the home screen or
							where you actually are throughout the application. A home bar or some type of navigation
							guidance or reference for the user would help a lot. Especially when more features are added
							to the application.</li>
						<li>[Visibility of system status] (Severity 2) - 1 of us
							When ingredients are removed from a dish, which ingredients were removed should be
							displayed. This could be done by having them greyed out or some other visual indicator.</li>
						<li>[Match Between System and the Real World] (Severity 2) - 1 of us
							I am confused by the overarching purpose of the “Vegan” and “Dairy Free” filtering-switch —
							would it make more sense to just simply mark such dishes on the menu for customers, so that
							customer with “Vegan” and “Dairy free” restrictions don’t need to ask the waiter but can
							just get this information by looking at the menu.</li>
						<li>[User Control and Freedom] (Severity 4) - 2 of us
							The note section is under-developed and confusing for first time user: is this for waiters
							to put in a note-for-self or to be sent to the kitchen for specific instructions? Where is
							the submit button? and how would the waiter know whether particular requirement from the
							customer is feasible on the kitchen’s end (without running back and forth between the
							kitchen and table).</li>
						<li>[User Control &amp; Freedom] (Severity 3) - 3 of us
							Right now with just the two options of “Vegan” or “Gluten Free” the system is not
							overwhelmed and doesn’t have a need for a “clear” or “reset” function. Though, as soon as
							there are more options the user will need a quick reset feature to provide them with the
							freedom and an “emergency exit” to get back to the starting position.</li>
						<li>[User control and freedom] (Severity 4) - 1 of us
							There’s no way to order anything from the interface. For an app targeted at restaurant
							servers, the lack of an ordering function feels wrong. The team should consider adding a
							shopping cart feature and an order button to complete the user flow of the application.</li>
						<li>[Consistency and standards] (Severity 3) - 2 of us
							When Vegan and Dairy Free are both selected on the main page, the notice for “<em>can be
								made Dairy Free upon Request” disappeared. This should be added for consistency with
								other pages. And the resulting menu items are all vegan items but not the intersection
								of vegan and dairy free items.
								10.[Consistency and Standards] (Severity 3) - 2 of us
								The note section in the “Spagheb” page seems to be playing a different purpose. I would
								argue that the “</em>” may be the best efficiency approach for waiter to capture info as
							they are oden placing order with 7me-constraints. As waiters would receive training on the
							system and dishes beforehand, I would recommend that the designers to use icon instead of
							plain words for standard warning and notifications.
							11.[Consistency and Standards] (Severity 3) - 1 of us
							The “Out of Stock” label only appears in the edit-mode and seems to come out of nowhere. If
							the designers intended to mean that this dish is out of stock, then the label should appear
							in the dish page (or make the dish “un- selectable” in the listing; if the designers
							intended to mean that particular ingredient is out of stock, then they can simply make such
							ingredient un- selectable.</li>
						<li>[Error prevention] (Severity 2) - 1 of us
							It seems very easy to misclick on ingredients you don’t want to delete. Should probably make
							the cross button bigger and consider adding a confirmation page.</li>
						<li>[Recognition rather than recall] (Severity 2) - 1 of us
							After the user has selected a dish, the Vegan and Dairy Free option bars should still be
							present so that users can see which filter they applied.
							14.[Flexibility &amp; Efficiency of Use] (Severity 3) - 1 of us
							Within the “sold out” pages there should be a notification on the menu task bar on the left
							side of the screen so you know what is sold out without having to click on it. This will
							accelerate the use of the application for users and make it more effective.</li>
						<li>[H6 Recognition Rather Than Recall] (Severity 3) - 1 of us
							It would be good to put initials such as “GF” or “V” by the line items in the table on the
							left. This would prevent users from having to use memory to recall whether or not an item
							they just looked up is in fact gluten free or vegan. It would allow for fast recognition of
							the required items for more efficient use of the application.
							16.[Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors] (Severity 4) - 1 of us
							In the dish page, the ingredients are listed is a rather disorganized manner, and the “X”
							for removal is preXy small and close to each other, potentially leading to errors in order
							placement. I recommend that: 1) ingredients should be beXer sorted based on their type; the
							ingredient could be color-coded or listed in different rows to reflect such categorization;
							2) Enlarge the remove button to prevent error and increase efficiency of use; 3) If the
							waiter accidentally removed an ingredient, the ingredient should not just disappear upon
							removal but listed in a section below for retrieve (if needed).</li>

					<h2 id="heuristic-evaluation-take-aways">Heuristic Evaluation Take Aways</h2>
					<p>We learned from our heuristic evaluation that we need to include more affordances that signal
						navigation throughout our app. We need to include more features like back arrows, home buttons
						and a clear all feature for the different filters. This will help the user move through the app
						with speed.</p>
					<p>We also need to make our interface use similar features of menus like icons that represent if
						menu items are gluten free or vegan, instead of only having the filters. This provides a quicker
						way to know if something fits a dietary restriction without needing to click anything.
						Additionally, having a visual for when menu items have sold out would help with quicker
						information retrieval. In the end, we need to focus on not just quickness of navigation, but
						more presentation of information, to minimize any need to navigate.</p>
					<p>Lastly, we also need to improve the editing capabilities of the platform. This includes creating
						a format to add ingredients as well as a more aesthetic way to remove ingredients. We should
						also include a confirmation checkbox after saving a menu item edit, to confirm if they want to
						make the changes that they have made. </p>
