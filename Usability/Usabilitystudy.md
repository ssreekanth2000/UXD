## Formal Usability Study Plan

In this study, we would like to test two different layout designs of our platform to learn which layout is more understandable and efficient for the user.

#### Hypothesis: 

The table layout will be more time-efficient than the switches layout and the users will be able to answer questions about food allergens faster. 

To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a usability test with 2-3 different people who have worked in a front-of-house restaurant. In this test, we will introduce 5-6 different scenarios where the user needs to find information and then we will measure how the participant responds. 

#### Independent Variables:

We will be changing the visual format of each menu item. One of our layouts will have the menu items in card format and have switches that filter the data. The other layout will have a table that presents all of the information and not have the option to filter the data with switches.

#### Quantitative Metrics (Dependent Variables):


##### Access time. 

This can be measured in terms of either the number of clicks required to access the required information or the amount of time the user spends on operations. We would like to measure which approach has the more optimized time.



##### Misclicks. 

We would like to measure the deviation in the user’s click flow from the “optimal” flow to reach a certain screen. This metric would be useful in measuring how clear/confusing our interface design is. An accurate hypothesis would have fewer misclicks. 


##### Type of gestures/clicks.

We would measure what kind of gestures people use and if they are what we think are the optimal ones. This metric would help us understand if the required gestures are obvious through our designs.

#### Questions for A/B testing:


Do you think the tables layout has way too much information?


Does the scrolling mechanism take too much time to find certain items?


Is filtering or a table view more intuitive for searching for information?


Which method of search seems more powerful?
